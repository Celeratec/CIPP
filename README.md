# What is this?
Manage365 is an improved Partner Portal based on the CIPP open source project, designed to help manage Office 365 tenant administration for Microsoft Partners. 
Manage365 is a way to help you with administering every aspect of Office 365, including user management, teams management, SharePoint management, and everything in between. It is also designed to help you deploy your own preferred standards to multiple tenants and to keep those standards applied. It's not a replacement for security tools or a way to cut costs on specific subscriptions, but the added tenant visibility and management options as well as the standards should help lessen the burden of managing multiple tenants, saving you several hours per engineer per month.
